<h2>Welcome to The List</h2>

<p>The List is a "social knowledge aggregator" made to solve the problems that befall other social bookmarking sites like Hacker News, Digg, and Reddit. Unlike other sites of its kind, a user's ability to post to The List is determined by an "influence rank" as opposed to the "post as much as you want" methodology. That  methodology results in what is called the "tragedy of the commons". This term, often used in economics, describes a situation in which many people, with their own interests in mind, sharing a resourceâˆ‚i together, causes the quality of the resource to deteriorate over time as more people use it. This happens because it is in each user's best interest to use the network as much as possible. By privatizing the ability to post with a 10-karma price-tag and adding thresholds to the number of users who can submit to The List, we should be able to create a board of ideas and links where quality does not deteriorate with quantity of users.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2><br>

<ul class="qa">
  <li>Q: How do I get onto The List?</li>
  <li>You need to receive an invite from another member. Then you can submit URLs.</li>

  <li>Q: What is influence rank?</li>
  <li>The influence rank is what makes The List tick. Your influence rank is a private score attributed to you that we calculate from your web presence. Say you have a GitHub repository that's very popular or a Dribbble shot with many likes, it will raise your influence rank when you log into the website. Your influence rank is calculated as a percentage of the entire website's mass and can fluctuate over time as The List's user-base grows and shrinks.</li>

  <li>Q: Why does it cost karma to post?</li>
  <li>This is part of quality control. We incentivize submitting only quality content by privatizing The List as a resource. You can gain karma by posting things people like.</li>

  <li>Q: Why are there no images on The List?</li>
  <li>The List is also aware of the tragedy of quick consumption. In other words, the problem that content that can be quickly read (or "consumed") and up-voted makes its way to the front page fastest. If The List displayed thumbnails of the sites they showed, we put quality content at risk if we can't find a thumbnail for it.</li>

  <li>Q: How much karma do I get for an up-vote?</li>
  <li>You get 2 karma every time someone up-votes your post, and 1 karma every time someone up-votes your comment.</li>

  <li>Q: What are the little icons next to posts on The List?</li>
  <li>These are the "trend" flags. They tell wether a post is on the rise or falling on The List.</li>

  <li>Q: Where can I see statistics about The List?</li>
  <li>Soon, you'll be able to check out this nifty page here: http://stats.thelist.io/</li>

  <li>Q: Why does it say my post can't be submitted?</li>
  <li>We do semi-intelligent quality control to prevent submitting URLs that already exist in our database and submissions that are only images.</li>

  <li>Q: What's with the comments? How can I reply directly to a comment?</li>
  <li>Part of the list is ensuring all content is quality, we think this should include commenting as well. We've taken cues from <a href="http://branch.com/">Branch</a> in building our comment system so that conversations can flow as if you were sitting at a dinner table. Though you can't reply directly to a comment, you can quote all or some of a previous user's comment.</li>

  <li>Q: I don't like democracy, how can I withdraw my vote on a post?</li>
  <li>Since The List is technically the intellectual property of Lamar Smith, we can't allow you to withdraw your vote, sorry about that.</li>
