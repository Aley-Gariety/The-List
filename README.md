Welcome to The List
-------------------

The List is a “social knowledge aggregator” made to solve the problems
that befall other social bookmarking sites like Hacker News, Digg, and
Reddit. Unlike other sites of its kind, a user’s ability to post to The
List is determined by an “influence rank” as opposed to the “post as
much as you want” methodology. That methodology results in what is
called the “tragedy of the commons”. This term, often used in economics,
describes a situation in which many people, with their own interests in
mind, sharing a resource∂i together, causes the quality of the resource
to deteriorate over time as more people use it. This happens because it
is in each user’s best interest to use the network as much as possible.
By privatizing the ability to post with a 10-karma price-tag and adding
thresholds to the number of users who can submit to The List, we should
be able to create a board of ideas and links where quality does not
deteriorate with quantity of users.

FAQ
---

\

-   Q: How do I get onto The List?
-   A: You need to receive an invite from another member. Then you can
    submit URLs.
-   Q: What is influence rank?
-   A: The influence rank is what makes The List tick. Your influence
    rank is a private score attributed to you that we calculate from
    your web presence. Say you have a GitHub repository that’s very
    popular or a Dribbble shot with many likes, it will raise your
    influence rank when you log into the website. Your influence rank is
    calculated as a percentage of the entire website’s mass and can
    fluctuate over time as The List’s user-base grows and shrinks. You
    must have an influence rank of over 50% in order to post to The
    List. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be a social media guru to have
    a high influence rank, and no users can see your exact influence
    rank.
-   Q: Why are there no images on The List?
-   A: The List is also aware of the tragedy of quick consumption. In
    other words, the problem that content that can be quickly read (or
    “consumed”) and up-voted makes its way to the front page fastest. If
    The List displayed thumbnails of the sites they showed, we put
    quality content at risk if we can’t find a thumbnail for it.
-   Q: How much karma do I get for an up-vote?
-   A: You get 2 karma every time someone up-votes your post, and 1
    karma every time someone up-votes your comment.
-   Q: What are the little icons next to posts on The List?
-   A: These are the “trend” flags. They tell wether a post is on the
    rise or falling on The List.
-   Q: Where can I see statistics about The List?
-   A: Soon, you’ll be able to check out this nifty page here:

-   Q: Why does it say my post can’t be submitted?
-   A: We do semi-intelligent quality control to prevent submitting URLs
    that already exist in our database and submissions that are only
    images.
-   Q: Why does it cost karma to post?
-   A: This is part of quality control. We incentivize submitting only
    quality content by privatizing The List as a resource. You can gain
    karma by posting things people like.
-   Q: What’s with the comments? How can I reply directly to a comment?
-   A: Part of the list is ensuring all content is quality, we think
    this should include commenting as well. We’ve taken cues from
    [Branch][] in building our comment system so that conversations can
    flow as if you were sitting at a dinner table. Though you can’t
    reply directly to a comment, you can quote all or some of a previous
    user’s comment.
-   Q: I don’t like democracy, how can I withdraw my vote on a post?
-   A: Send personal@jacksongariety.com an email outlining your
    frustration with the democratic system of the website as well as
    your username and we will remove your vote from the database in a
    timely manner.
