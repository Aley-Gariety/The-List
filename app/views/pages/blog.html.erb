<p>We are excited to #rollout some of our latest updates to The List. We have implemented the ideas you all have shared with us, such as markdown in comments, and better profile pages. In addition we have made some changes that we think you will love, both visually and under the hood. <a href="/blog/spit-and-shine">Changelog</a></p>

<p>TheList.io has currently experienced some downtime, this is due to a failure on our server while preforming system updates. We have taken measures to make sure this will not happen in the future. Thanks for your support, and as always, let us know if you have any questions or feedback. -Colby</p>

<p>It is currently possible to grab the JSON of both the <a href="http://thelist.io/posts.json">front page</a> and the <a href="http://thelist.io/posts/recent.json">recents page</a>. We are exploring the possibility of accepting posts through the API, but are specifically focused on reading for the time being. If you are building an app that uses the API, we would love to talk to you! If you would like to see something added to the API, you should <a href="mailto:colby@aley.me,business@jacksongariety.com">shoot us an email</a> also.</p>
