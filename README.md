The List
=============

The List is a new kind of social knowledge aggregator made to solve the problems of other bookmarkign and news sites like Hacker News, Digg, and Reddit. Unlike other social news websites, users' ability to post to The List is determined by an "influence rank" as opposed to the methodology of "post as much as you want" that's common on other social news websites. This system has many major pitfalls which together are often called the "tragedy of the commons". It describes a problem where many people with their own ideas can make something they all share much worse, even if no one intends to. By privatizing the social space and adding thresholds to the ability to submit to The List, the idea is to create a network who's quality of content doesn't decrease with the number of users on the network.

FAQ
-------------

 - Q: Why are there no images on The List
   A: The List is also aware of the tragedy of quick consumption. In other words, the problem that content that can be quickly read (or "consumed") and upvoted makes its way to the front page fastest. If The List displayed thumbnails of the sites they showed, we put quality content at risk if we can't find a thumbnail for it.

 - Q: How do I get onto The List
   A: You need to receive some karma as a gift from another member.
